# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python programming journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn Python from the basics to more advanced concepts.

## 📚 About My Journey

I'm **Faustino Henriques** (f50kdev), and this repository contains all the code, experiments, and projects I've created while learning Python. Each file represents a different concept or technique I've explored during my studies.

## 🎯 Learning Progress

### ✅ Completed Topics

#### 1. **Variables and Data Types** (`variableApp.py`)
- Understanding primitive data types (int, float, string, boolean)
- Variable naming conventions and best practices
- Working with different data types in Python

#### 2. **String Manipulation** (`StringApp.py`, `StringAppMethods.py`)
- String slicing and indexing
- String methods: `upper()`, `lower()`, `capitalize()`, `title()`
- String formatting with f-strings
- String operations: `find()`, `replace()`, `strip()`, `center()`
- String length and character access

#### 3. **Numbers and Math Operations** (`NumberApp.py`, `NumbersApp.py`)
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, //, **)
- Complex numbers in Python
- Math module usage (`math.ceil()`, `math.sqrt()`)
- Type conversions and rounding
- User input handling with `input()` function

#### 4. **Advanced String Concepts** (`ScapeSquenceApp.py`)
- Escape sequences in strings
- String concatenation and formatting
- Working with special characters

#### 5. **Text-to-Speech Integration** (`voiceApp.py`)
- Using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library
- Creating audio files from text
- Playing audio files with system commands
- Multilingual text-to-speech capabilities

#### 6. **File Operations and Search** (`FindApp.py`)
- File searching and manipulation
- Working with file paths and directories

#### 7. **Calibration and Testing** (`calibracessApp.py`)
- Application testing and calibration
- Debugging and error handling

## 🎵 Audio Projects

I've also created several audio files as part of my learning:
- `audio.mp3` - Basic text-to-speech output
- `audioAI.mp3` - AI-related audio content
- `soma.mp3` - Mathematical calculations with voice output
- `SweetGirls` - Personal audio project

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x** - Core programming language
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** - For audio generation
- **math** - Mathematical operations
- **os** - System operations
- **decimal** - Decimal precision handling

## 💡 Personal Notes

This journey has been exciting! I've learned that Python is a powerful and versatile language. The text-to-speech integration was particularly fun - being able to make the computer "speak" my code results was amazing!

Each file in this repository represents a step forward in my understanding of Python programming. I'm documenting everything to track my progress and help others who might be on a similar learning path.
